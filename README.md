Jargon-core consists of the following libraries

* jargon-core - base libraries, implementation of the iRODS protocol
* jargon-data-utils - additional functionality for dealing with iRODS data, such as building trees, storing information in iRODS on behalf of applications, and doing diffs between local and iRODS
* jargon-user-tagging - code for using free tagging and other metadata metaphors on top of iRODS
* jargon-user-profile - allows management of user profile and related configuration data in a user home directory
* jargon-ticket - support for ticket processing
* jargon-httpstream - stream http content into iRODS via Jargon
* jargon-ruleservice - support for running and managing rules from interfaces

## Requirements

* Jargon depends on Java 1.8+
* Jargon is built using Apache Maven2, see POM for dependencies
